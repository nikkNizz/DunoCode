DunoCode is a scripting language based on simple sequences of unique directives
(Duno = Direttiva UNO), mainly adapted to Linux systems.
**To write code, just keep the guide with the list of functions at hand.**
In DunoCode everything is an internal function with any parameters, including delimiters
blocks and variable assignment!

The interpreter is a simple program, written in any language, and is part
integral to the scripting process, as it provides the input graphical elements
and output and must always be launched in order to execute the code.

DunoCode is mainly aimed at 'on the fly' execution of scripts, but also:
  when executing files;
  to the creation of scripts with a partial graphical interface;
  to those who want to perform operations with a unique, schematic and simple syntax.
  at those who don't like the cryptic commands typical of bash (awk, sed, expr etc...).
